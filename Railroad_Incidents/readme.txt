Railroad Equipment Accident/Incident Source Data (Form 54)

Since last August, the Federal Railroad Administration has been rolling out a new portal for its 
safety data. Through it, you can find datasets on incidents and accidents involving railroad 
equipment, incidents at grade crossings, and reported injuries and illnesses, as well as dashboards 
and reports on related topics. The grade crossing dataset, for instance, lists 246,000+ incidents 
since 1975; it indicates each incidentâ€™s date, railroad, crossing identifier, nearest station, 
number of injuries, vehicle and train speeds, and much more. Previously: Blocked rail crossings 
(DIP 2023.05.10).
